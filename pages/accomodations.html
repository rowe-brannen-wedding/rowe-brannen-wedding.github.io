        We have reserved blocks of rooms at two hotels under the name
        <i>Brannen-Rowe Wedding</i>. The blocks are available for Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights. The price is guaranteed
        as longs as rooms remain available until the end of August 2018. Please be aware that Keeneland Racecourse is open
        and there is a University of Kentucky home football game that weekend, so hotel options will be limited. Click the address of each hotel to open it in Google Maps.
