            We have reserved blocks of rooms at three hotels under the name
            <i>Brannen-Rowe Wedding</i>. The blocks are available for Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights. The price is
            guaranteed as long as rooms remain available until September 18th 2018. Please be aware that Keeneland Racecourse
            is open and there is a University of Kentucky home football game that weekend, so hotel options will be limited.
