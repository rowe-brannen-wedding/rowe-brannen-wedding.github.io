        Jason and Kathleen met at Butler University… Ask the bridal party for more information.
        <br>
        <br> Fast forward four years. Jason and Kathleen went on a family vacation to Hilton Head with Kathleen’s parents, Michael
        and Amy. Hilton Head has always been a safe haven and home away from home for the Brannen family. It is where Kathleen
        took her first steps, lost her first tooth, and where the Brannen family spent many summer vacations retreating from
        the stress of everyday life. This year was extremely special because family vacation lasted for two weeks. The first
        week consisted of Michael and Jason working remotely, while Amy and Kathleen relaxed at the pool. At the end of the
        first week, Jason sat down with Michael and discussed how he planned to ask Kathleen to marry him. Michael was absolutely
        thrilled. So thrilled, in fact, that he said “I am so excited to have you as a brother-in-law!” To which Jason politely
        retorted, “Well, I hope you’ll be just as happy if I'm your son-in-law!”
        <br>
        <br> Later that evening, Jason asked Kathleen to go for a walk on the beach. Walking on the beach is a favorite pastime
        of the Brannens, but not so much for Jason. So when asked, Kathleen was excited for alone time after Jason’s week
        of working. It was on this walk that Jason popped the question. Because of all the excitement, Kathleen doesn’t actually
        remember saying yes, but Jason assures her she did! Meanwhile, Amy had gone upstairs to take a shower and get ready
        for dinner. Michael was about to pee his pants with excitement, as he had been asked to keep the proposal a secret.
        He finally couldn't hold it any longer and said, “Amy, I need you to come downstairs and see something”. Amy, now
        clean and warm in her robe after a shower, said, “No, not right now.” Michael responded, “Amy, this is important!”
        As she reluctantly put her clothes on to go outside, she frustratedly responded, “Michael, this better not just be
        that damn bird we saw earlier!” Michael said, “No, Kathleen and Jason are getting engaged!” Michael and Amy met Jason
        and Kathleen on the beach with celebratory hugs. That evening, they spent the night celebrating at their favorite
        local restaurant, Hudson’s.
